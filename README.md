# TU Film Telegram Bot
> Useful Telegram Bot to stay updated about the upcoming schedule for TU Film

Do you also have a group in Telegram where you and your fellow students decide if you are going to the
next movie shown in TU Film? We are in such a group and you often face the same dialogues in there. Here are just a
few examples:

A: *Hey, who's going tonight?* <br />
B: *What movie?*

A: *Who's going to watch movie X tonight?* <br />
B: *What's movie X about? Is it good*

A: *Should we meet before?* <br />
B: *When does the movie start?*

This leads to looking up these thing on the TU Film page, Google, or IMDb. THis this bot you can get all this
 information directly into Telegram. See below for all possible features.
